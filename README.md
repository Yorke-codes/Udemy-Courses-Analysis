# Udemy-Courses-Analysis
This report conducts an analysis of Udemy course data to evaluate pricing, popularity, revenue, and engagement trends. Insights highlight top-performing subjects, learner preferences, and opportunities for growth through optimized content, pricing, and course diversity.

## Project Summary
This project analyzes data from one of the world's largest online learning platforms to evaluate course performance, popularity, subscriber preferences, and revenue generation trends. The dataset includes information from over 12 million subscribers and contains 3,672 records of courses across four subjects. The insights gained from this study will help stakeholders understand the dynamics of course engagement and identify opportunities for growth and optimization in course offerings. The project utilizes an interactive dashboard to:

 1. Explore course characteristics by analyzing subject categories, levels, and content duration.
 2. Examine user engagement, preferences, and course effectiveness by investigating the relationship between subscribers, reviews, and various courses/subjects.
 3. Analyze pricing distribution and compare paid versus free courses to gain insights into market dynamics and consumer preferences within the Udemy platform.

## Research Questions
 1.What is the price distribution across different subjects and course levels, and which courses generate the most revenue?
 2. How has the number of published courses changed over time?
 3. Which courses or subjects are top performers based on reviews or subscriber counts?
 4. How do subscriber engagement, distribution, and growth vary across different courses and subjects?
 5. How does the duration of course content relate to pricing and subscriber numbers?

## Findings

### Price Distribution**
The analysis showed that a significant majority of the courses on the platform, approximately 92%, are paid, while only 8% are offered for free. This indicates that learners tend to value premium content. Among the paid courses, the average price is about $66, with prices ranging from $20 to $200.

### Course Performance analysis
Web development courses are the leading category in terms of subscription numbers, boasting around 8 million subscribers and generating approximately $630 million in revenue. A significant portion of users are subscribed to all-level courses (59%) and beginner-level courses (35%). This trend suggests a focus on entry-level or general audiences, highlighting a lack of content available for more advanced learners.

### User Engagement
The platform has demonstrated annual growth in the number of subscribers across various course levels and subjects from 2011 to 2016. With 575,000 reviews and a feedback rate of 4.8% from a total of 12 million subscribers, it's clear that the number of reviews influences subscriber numbers. Courses that receive a higher number of reviews typically attract more enrollments.

### Course Duration
The typical Udemy course has approximately 40 lectures and about 4.1 hours of content. Longer courses tend to attract more subscribers, suggesting that students prefer in-depth material over shorter modules.

## Conclusion
Udemy users tend to prefer technical courses, which significantly contribute to the platform's performance in terms of subscriptions and revenue generation. Additionally, Udemy has effectively captured a substantial market of beginners and generalists, particularly in high-demand areas like web development. However, there are opportunities to diversify course offerings by expanding content for intermediate and expert levels. Furthermore, refining pricing strategies and incorporating more free courses could help attract and convert new users.

## Recommendations
 1. Attention should be directed toward developing more courses that are in high demand, such as Web Development and Business Finance.
 2. We should encourage student ratings and feedback, as higher-rated classes tend to attract more students and generate increased revenue.
 3. Additionally, offering more free courses can help drive traffic and lead to higher conversions for paid courses.
